Without dataset, it is just a car without petrol we canâ€™t move ahead. For quite a while I was working on Object detection algorithms. The first problem I would encounter is to find sufficient labelled data to prepare a customized dataset. I would end up searching for various dataset resources such as Google Dataset search or Kaggle to meet my requirements.\n","\n","This repository has really made life easier (at least for me ðŸ˜‰). This amazing toolkit allows you to download images from OID v4 seamlessly. The installation is easy and clearly mentioned in the readme file. The toolkit is loaded with a variety of options.OIDv4 Toolkit allows you to download any particular class of interest. The toolkit can be cloned by the following command [Read more](https://medium.com/@c.n.veeraganesh/how-to-prepare-your-own-customized-dataset-using-open-images-dataset-v4-8dfce9b9e147)\n","\n","git
